This project was developed for the purpose of providing a responsive, clean, and robust mobile application that fills a niche gap for puzzle enthusiasts. To ensure a positive user experience; industry-accepted best practices were adhered to during development.

These best-practices include research into our potential users and competitors, designing the app with a bottom-up approach, having a robust yet light-weight framework and deep consideration into having high accessibility and inclusivity.

The overall design and development process would be conducted around the core purpose of the app, which is to create, scan and complete Sudoku/Crossword puzzles (and more). Other additions would be implemented in a way that benefits or synergizes with the core feature.
